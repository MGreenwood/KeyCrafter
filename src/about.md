KeyCrafter â€“ System & Codebase Overview

1. Current Systems
A. Typing & Movement System
Mechanics: Players type words to select and move toward resources. Each word is associated with a resource node. Typing progress is tracked per word, and only the word with a mistake is reset.
Pathfinding: Uses A* algorithm to move the player character (@) to the selected resource. Players can harvest resources within 2 moves of the target.

B. Resource & Node Management
Resource Nodes: Represented as ASCII art objects (e.g., trees, copper ore). Each node has a harvest limit (TTL), randomized per node/type.
Harvesting: When within 2 moves of a node and word is completed, the player collects resources. Nodes deplete after their TTL and may respawn elsewhere, avoiding overlap and respecting a max node count per island.

C. Word System
Words: Organized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard) with automatic space trimming.
Progression: Easy words for wood, medium for copper, with space for expansion.

D. Distribution System
Binary Distribution: Secure SFTP server in Docker container for binary distribution.
Security Features:
- SSH key-based authentication only
- 30-day key rotation
- Fail2ban protection
- Restricted SFTP-only access
- Container isolation with minimal privileges
- Resource limits and system call restrictions
- Read-only filesystem
- Network isolation

2. File Responsibilities
File	Purpose/Responsibility
main.rs	Game loop, UI rendering, input handling, main state management (Game, Player, etc.)
ascii_objects.rs	ASCII art definitions and rendering for resource nodes
floating_text.rs	Floating text effect logic and management
islands.rs	Island, resource pool, and node spawning logic
pathfinding.rs	A* pathfinding implementation and grid/position logic
resource_types.rs	Shared ResourceType enum and resource-related helpers
word_lists.rs	Word management and difficulty levels
Dockerfile	Container configuration for binary distribution
security-policy.json	Seccomp security policy for container
docker-compose.yml	Container orchestration and security settings
setup_keys.sh	SSH key generation and rotation

3. Key Structs & Enums
Game (main.rs): Central game state (player, resources, islands, etc.)
Player (main.rs): Player position, inventory, and movement state
Resource (main.rs): Individual resource node state with path tracking
AsciiObject, ResourceObjects (ascii_objects.rs): ASCII art and resource node visuals
FloatingText, FloatingTextManager (floating_text.rs): Floating text effect and manager
Island, ResourcePool, IslandManager (islands.rs): Island and resource pool logic
Position, Grid (pathfinding.rs): Pathfinding and grid logic
ResourceType (resource_types.rs): Enum for all resource types
WordList, WordDifficulty (word_lists.rs): Word management and difficulty levels

4. Current Features
- Word-based movement and resource collection
- Multi-word simultaneous typing
- Distance-based harvesting (within 2 moves)
- ASCII art resource visualization
- Floating text feedback
- Word difficulty progression
- Secure binary distribution

5. Known Issues / Technical Debt
- No State Saving: Progress is not persisted between sessions
- Single Island: Only one island currently implemented
- Planned Features Not Yet Implemented:
  - Crafting System
  - Upgrade System
  - Multiple Islands
  - Idle Progression
- No Automated Tests
- No Error Handling for Corrupt State

6. Goals & Next Steps
Short Term:
- Monitor and maintain distribution system security
- Implement basic state saving/loading
- Add error handling for corrupt/missing files

Medium Term:
- Implement crafting system with sentence typing
- Add upgrade system for resource yields
- Expand to multiple islands

Long Term:
- Add idle progression
- Implement automated testing
- Enhance typing content variety
- Improve UI/UX accessibility

7. Security & Distribution
The game binary is distributed through a hardened Docker container:
- Secure SFTP access only
- Key-based authentication
- Regular key rotation
- Container isolation
- Resource limits
- Network restrictions
- Filesystem protection
