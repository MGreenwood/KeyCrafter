# KeyCrafter üî®‚å®Ô∏è

A terminal-based typing game disguised as a resource gathering/crafting adventure. Improve your typing speed while exploring islands and collecting resources!

## Quick Install

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm play.keycrafter.fun/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
curl -fsSL play.keycrafter.fun/install.sh | bash
```

After installing, just type `keycrafter` in your terminal to play!

## Features

- **Console-based gameplay** - Runs entirely in your terminal
- **Typing mechanics** - Type words to move your character and harvest resources
- **Pathfinding** - Your character automatically navigates to resources using A* pathfinding
- **Real-time feedback** - Letters turn green as you type them correctly, reset on mistakes
- **Resource collection** - Gather wood from trees and copper from ore deposits
- **Lightweight** - Single binary, easily distributable

## How to Play

1. **Select a resource** - Type the first letter of any word floating above a resource (üå≤ tree or ‚õ∞ copper ore)
2. **Complete the word** - Type the complete word letter by letter
   - Correct letters turn green
   - Wrong letters reset the word (you start over)
3. **Watch your character move** - Once you complete a word, your character (‚ñ†) will pathfind to that resource
4. **Collect resources** - When your character reaches the resource, you'll gain materials and get a new word
5. **Quit** - Press 'q' to exit, or 'Esc' to deselect current resource

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Rust (install from https://rustup.rs/)

### Build and Run
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd KeyCrafter

# Build and run in one command
cargo run

# Or build a release binary
cargo build --release
```

## Game Mechanics

- **Character**: Blue square (‚ñ†) that moves around the island
- **Resources**: 
  - üå≤ Trees (give wood)
  - ‚õ∞ Copper Ore (gives copper)
- **Words**: Random selection covering various keys for typing practice
- **Movement**: A* pathfinding ensures your character takes the optimal route
- **Islands**: Currently one island, with plans for multiple islands with different resources

## Controls

- **Type letters** - Select and complete words to harvest resources
- **Esc** - Deselect current resource (or quit if nothing selected)
- **q** - Quit game
- **F10** - Quick exit (works anytime)

## Technical Details

- Built with Rust for performance and easy distribution
- Uses `ratatui` for terminal UI rendering
- Uses `crossterm` for cross-platform terminal handling
- Uses `pathfinding` crate for A* pathfinding algorithm
- Lightweight dependencies, compiles to a single binary

## Future Plans

- Multiple islands with different resource types
- Crafting system using longer phrases/sentences
- Idle progression (resources accumulate while offline)
- More varied typing content (quotes, code snippets, etc.)
- Character progression and tool upgrades
- Save system for persistent progress
