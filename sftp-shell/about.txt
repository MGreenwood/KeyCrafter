KeyCrafter is more than just a typing game - it's a mindful break in your workday.

In our fast-paced development world, we often forget to take meaningful breaks. KeyCrafter 
transforms these breaks into moments of both rest and improvement. As you gather resources 
and explore the world, you're not just playing a game - you're maintaining your typing 
skills, a crucial tool in any developer's arsenal.

Built with Rust and love for the terminal, KeyCrafter embraces the philosophy that 
productivity tools should be both useful and enjoyable. The game features:

  🌳 Resource gathering through typing
  🎯 Distance-based harvesting mechanics
  📝 Progressive word difficulty
  🎨 ASCII art visuals
  🔄 Dynamic resource respawning

Take a moment. Type a few words. Watch your resources grow.
Sometimes the best way to keep coding is to stop coding - just for a little while.
